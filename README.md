# Milestone 1
- Author: Ashley Barron
- Application Name: **Music Store
- CST-391
- Title: **Milestone 1




# Introduction
 - For this milestone I plan on creating a music store. The store will sell a variety of products, including musical instruments such as guitars and pianos, accesories like guitar picks and strings, and music media such as CDs and DVDs.

- The application will allow users to browse and manage these products through a simple back-end and front-end system, combining functionality for listing, creating, reading, updating, and deleting a "product". This milestone will help demonstrate the application of back-end and front-end technologies, including the use of databases, REST APIs, and user interfaces.
