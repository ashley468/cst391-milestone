# Milestone 3
- Author: Ashley Barron
- Application Name: Music Store
- Class: CST-391
- Title: Milestone 3

# Introduction
- For my milestone, I'm developing a web application for a music store. In this store, I will be selling a variety of products such as musical instruments (guitars, drum kits, and violins), accessories (guitar picks, violin bows, and drumsticks), and Media (CDs, DVDs, and vinyl records). The application will allow users to browse through a simple back-end and front-end system, providing  functionality for reading, creating, listing, listing, updating, and deleting an item/product from the store. This milestone will desmonstrate the application's bacn-end and front-end technologies, including the use of Databases, REST APIs, and user interfaces. 

# Changes 
- ** For the milestone I only mae one change, where I changed the instrument "battery" to "drum kit" to make it a bit more clear and avoid confusion. In future milestones I may add a piano or other instruments. The three instruments I chose are to get me going for the beggining of the milestone. I may do the same for accessories. I may add guitar strings, or objects to clean instruments. For media I could add music sheets, or bue ray disks.
